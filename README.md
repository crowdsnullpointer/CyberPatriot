## Installation

First, clone this repository:

<!-- start:code block -->
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/crowdsnullpointer/CyberPatriot.git
cd CyberPatriot

# Execute program
python3 Debain.py
<!-- end:code block -->

# Main focus
> This program really focues on any debain-based distros like ubuntu. This script is not focused on securing server services like 'mysql'. All though 'ssh' is configured in this it is mainly used on both systems anyway.
# ToDo
- Scrape readme (HTML) from cyberpatriot client to get users/adms -->
- Add some colors -->
- more debuging information -->

---
> Do not rely on this program as each scenario is unique to each year in any CyberPatriot competion, this is more of a start to automate commands as possible.
